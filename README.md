[Chloromaps.com](https://chloromaps.com/) helps non-programmers build choropleth visualizations. It has more than 20+ Maps of countries and continents based on Mercator, Robinson projections.

> This is also an Open-source alternative to Mapchart.net 🥳

## Motivation

When I was 17 back in 2019 I created an Instagram page called `@maps_affinity` during my summer break. I used to curate and post content around choropleth visualizations. I used to use other 3rd part software like mapchart to curate those maps. Always wanted to build my version of it but I wasn't programming back then.

Started programming in 2020 May, at this point the page grew to over 19,000+ followers and had hit 1million+ impressions. I tried and failed twice to build it. Nevertheless, I am glad I don't get disappointed by my failure and instead take breaks and move on.

After failing to build it twice and I finally shipped Chloromaps.com, the product I wanted to build since 2019. It’s really beautiful to see an idea becoming a live product all it needs is a lot of consistent efforts.
