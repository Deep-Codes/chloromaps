import PageLayout from '@/layouts/PageLayout';

**Chloromaps.com** would never be possible without the availability of Awesome libraries and frameworks. To give the community back the same favour I would be open sourcing the libraries I built along the way.

export default ({ children }) => (
    <PageLayout title="Open Source" showNav>
        {children}
    </PageLayout>
);
