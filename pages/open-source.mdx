import PageLayout from '@/layouts/PageLayout';

**chloromaps.com** would never be possible without the availability of Awesome libraries and frameworks. To give the community back the same favour i would be open sourcing the libraries i build along the way.

export default ({ children }) => (
    <PageLayout title="Open Source" showNav>
        {children}
    </PageLayout>
);
